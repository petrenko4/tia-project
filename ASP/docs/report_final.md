# Retrospective:
<!-- If you were to do this again, what would you do differently? --> 
<!-- Are you proud of your work? What aspect of the project do you think is the most well-done? -->
- If I were to do the project again, I would aim to make the website more versatile and eliminate some of the current flaws in its behavior and functionality.

 - I am proud of my work, especially considering that this was my first real experience building a web application. During the project, I learned a lot about both frontend and backend development.
The playlist functionality is, in my opinion, the best feature of the project.
